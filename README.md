# open_scale
Open scale aims to bring together the interactivity and immediate feedback of OSC to scaling your avatar in VRChat

## How to clone
This repository has submodules, please use `--recurse-submodules` when cloning:
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/rtlcopymemory/open_scale.git
```

or through SSH:
```
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:rtlcopymemory/open_scale.git
```

## Other needs
This needs to be synced with a way to scale the avatar (and armature) in VRChat. Currently haven't figured out a decent way but I want to publish this driver to allow for collaboration
